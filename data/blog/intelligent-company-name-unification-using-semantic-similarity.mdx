## Overview

In modern email processing systems, one common challenge is dealing with variations of company names. The same company might appear with slightly different names across multiple emails - for example, "Microsoft Corp", "Microsoft Corporation", or "Microsoft Inc". This post describes how we implemented an intelligent system to unify these company names using semantic similarity.

## Implementation

### Core Features

- OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model for semantic analysis
- Batch processing with similarity threshold â‰¥ 0.7
- MongoDB-based permanent storage system with local TTLCache for performance

### Performance Improvement

Implemented a two-tier caching system with MongoDB permanent storage and local TTLCache for company embeddings, achieved 95x performance improvement.

- Without cache: ~1.8s per API call
- With cache: ~0.019s per request
- 95x performance improvement

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Matching**

   - Company subsidiaries recognition
   - Multilingual support

2. **Analytics**
   - Industry classification
   - Company relationship tracking

This solution significantly improves data consistency and processing efficiency in our email analysis system.
