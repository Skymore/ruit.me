# Understanding the Word Ladder Problem

The **Word Ladder** problem is a classic puzzle frequently posed in coding interviews. It requires transforming one word into another by altering a single character at each step and ensuring every intermediate word exists in a given dictionary (word list).

## Problem Statement

You are given:

1. A **beginWord**.
2. An **endWord**.
3. A list of valid words called **wordList**.

You need to find the **shortest transformation sequence** from **beginWord** to **endWord**, where each transformation:

- Changes exactly one character in the current word.
- Produces a new word that must exist in the wordList.

If no valid transformation sequence exists, you must return **0**.

Formally:

- A transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord` is:
  ```
  beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk  (where sk == endWord)
  ```
- Each pair of adjacent words in this sequence differs by exactly one letter.
- Each intermediate word sáµ¢ must belong to **wordList**.
- **beginWord** itself does not have to be in **wordList**.
- The function returns the **number of steps** in the shortest sequence (i.e., k + 1, because `beginWord` counts as the first step). If no path is found, return **0**.

### Example

```
beginWord = "hit"
endWord   = "cog"
wordList  = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Shortest transformation:
hit -> hot -> dot -> dog -> cog

Answer: 5
```

# Approach Overview

We'll discuss **four** methods in detail:

1. **Pre-Build Adjacency List (Naive)**
2. **On-the-Fly BFS (No Preprocessing)**
3. **Wildcard Mapping (More Efficient)**
4. **Bidirectional BFS (Advanced Optimization)**

---

## Approach 1: Pre-Build the Adjacency List (Naive)

### Method Description

1. Compare **every pair** of words in the dictionary to see if they differ by a single letter.
2. If they do, record that connection in an adjacency list (a graph structure).
3. Perform a BFS from `beginWord` until `endWord` is reached.

### Time Complexity

- **Graph construction**: \(O(N^2 \times L)\)
  - We have \(N\) words and compare each pair, needing \(O(L)\) time for each pair to see if they differ by one letter.
- **BFS**: \(O(N + E)\), but \(E\) can be up to \(O(N^2)\).
- Overall can reach \(O(N^2 \times L)\) in practice.

### Code Example

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        # If the endWord is not in wordList, no valid sequence
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return 0

        # Convert to set and include beginWord if missing
        wordSet = set(wordList)
        wordSet.add(beginWord)
        words = list(wordSet)

        # Helper to check if two words differ by exactly one letter
        def differ_by_one(w1: str, w2: str) -> bool:
            diff_count = 0
            for c1, c2 in zip(w1, w2):
                if c1 != c2:
                    diff_count += 1
                    if diff_count > 1:
                        return False
            return diff_count == 1

        # 1) Build the graph (adjacency list) - O(N^2 * L)
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        n = len(words)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if differ_by_one(words[i], words[j]):
                    graph[words[i]].append(words[j])
                    graph[words[j]].append(words[i])

        # 2) BFS to find the shortest path
        queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])
        visited = set([beginWord])

        while queue:
            word, steps = queue.popleft()
            # If we've reached the endWord, return the distance
            if word == endWord:
                return steps

            for neighbor in graph[word]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, steps + 1))

        return 0
```

**Pros**: Straightforward to understand.  
**Cons**: Can be slow when `N` is large.

---

## Approach 2: On-the-Fly BFS (No Preprocessing)

Instead of building an entire adjacency list first, you **directly** do a BFS:

1. Start from `beginWord`.
2. In each BFS step, compare the current word to every remaining word in your set to find neighbors that differ by one letter.
3. Enqueue those neighbors and mark them visited.

### Time Complexity

- Each time you dequeue a word, you may compare it with **all** words in the set.
- In the worst case, \(O(N^2 \times L)\).

### Code Example

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        word_set = set(wordList)
        if endWord not in word_set:
            return 0

        queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])
        visited = set([beginWord])

        def differ_by_one(w1: str, w2: str) -> bool:
            diff_count = 0
            for c1, c2 in zip(w1, w2):
                if c1 != c2:
                    diff_count += 1
                    if diff_count > 1:
                        return False
            return diff_count == 1

        while queue:
            word, steps = queue.popleft()
            if word == endWord:
                return steps

            # Convert set to list to avoid runtime error
            for candidate in list(word_set):
                if differ_by_one(word, candidate):
                    if candidate == endWord:
                        return steps + 1
                    visited.add(candidate)
                    queue.append((candidate, steps + 1))
                    # Remove from the set to prevent re-check
                    word_set.remove(candidate)

        return 0
```

**Pros**: Minimal code without pre-building a graph.  
**Cons**: Still \(O(N^2 \times L)\) in worst-case scenarios.

---

## Approach 3: Wildcard Mapping (More Efficient)

To avoid the \(N^2\) blowup, we can:

1. Generate **wildcard patterns** (like `h*t`, `*ot`) for every word in the dictionary.
2. Store in a hash map: **pattern -> list of words** that match it.
3. Use BFS. For a given word, to find its neighbors, generate its \(L\) wildcard forms and look them up directly in the hash map.

### Time Complexity (Detailed)

- **Preprocessing**:
  - For \(N\) words, each of length \(L\), generating \(L\) wildcard strings.
  - Each generation is \(O(L)\) due to slicing, so \(O(N \times L^2)\) total.
- **BFS**:
  - Potentially \(O(N \times L^2)\) again, because each word might generate \(L\) patterns in \(O(L)\).
- Overall typically \(O(N \times L^2)\), which is far better than \(O(N^2 \times L)\) when \(N\) is large, as long as each pattern doesn't map to a huge number of words.

### Code Example

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        word_set = set(wordList)
        if endWord not in word_set:
            return 0

        # Preprocess the wordList to build a pattern map
        pattern_map = defaultdict(list)
        L = len(beginWord)

        for word in word_set:
            for i in range(L):
                pattern = word[:i] + '*' + word[i+1:]
                pattern_map[pattern].append(word)

        # BFS initialization
        queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])
        visited = set([beginWord])

        while queue:
            word, steps = queue.popleft()

            for i in range(L):
                wildcard = word[:i] + '*' + word[i+1:]
                neighbors = pattern_map[wildcard]
                for neighbor in neighbors:
                    if neighbor == endWord:
                        return steps + 1
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append((neighbor, steps + 1))

                # Clear the list to avoid re-processing the same neighbors in future iterations
                pattern_map[wildcard] = []

        return 0
```

**Pros**: Often **much** faster than naive methods in large dictionaries.  
**Cons**: A bit more complex to implement, and in extreme cases where a pattern maps to many words, it can degrade.

---

## Approach 4: Bidirectional BFS (Advanced Optimization)

Even with wildcard mapping, BFS might traverse a large portion of the graph. A powerful trick is **Bidirectional BFS**:

1. Start one search from `beginWord` and another from `endWord`.
2. Expand each frontier level by level.
3. If the two frontiers ever intersect, you have found the shortest path.

This effectively **cuts the search space** roughly in half (or more), providing an exponential speedup in many cases.

### Time Complexity

- In the best or average scenario, the **depth** from each side shrinks from \(d\) to about \(d/2\), greatly reducing the total number of visits.
- Implementation details vary, but combining **bidirectional BFS** with **wildcard mapping** is typically the fastest known approach for large inputs.

### Code Example (Bidirectional BFS with Wildcard)

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        word_set = set(wordList)
        if endWord not in word_set:
            return 0

        L = len(beginWord)
        # Pre-build wildcard patterns
        pattern_map = defaultdict(list)
        for word in word_set:
            for i in range(L):
                pattern = word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]
                pattern_map[pattern].append(word)

        # Initialize two "fronts": one from beginWord, one from endWord
        begin_set = {beginWord}
        end_set = {endWord}
        visited = {beginWord, endWord}
        distance = 1  # We'll count 'beginWord' as the first step

        # Perform bidirectional BFS
        while begin_set and end_set:
            # Always expand the smaller frontier for efficiency
            if len(begin_set) > len(end_set):
                begin_set, end_set = end_set, begin_set

            next_level = set()
            distance += 1  # Increment distance for each level

            for word in begin_set:
                for i in range(L):
                    pattern = word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]
                    for neighbor in pattern_map[pattern]:
                        if neighbor in end_set:
                            return distance  # Found intersection
                        if neighbor not in visited:
                            visited.add(neighbor)
                            next_level.add(neighbor)

            begin_set = next_level  # Update frontier for next iteration

        return 0  # No path found
```

**How it works**:

1. We maintain two "search fronts": one from `beginWord` (forward) and one from `endWord` (backward).
2. Each iteration, we expand the smaller set of words by one step.
3. If the new set of visited words intersects with the other frontier, it means we've found a path in `distance` transformations total.
4. The wildcard mapping ensures quick neighbor lookups (avoiding an \(N^2\) blowup).

**Pros**:

- Often the fastest approach, especially for large dictionaries.
- Greatly prunes the search space.

**Cons**:

- More code complexity due to maintaining two fronts and deciding when they intersect.

# Edge Cases and Takeaways

1. **Edge Cases**

   - If `endWord` is not in the wordList, return 0 immediately.
   - If `beginWord == endWord`, some variations might consider the length as 1 or 0, but typically this scenario is trivially no transformation needed or is not applicable in standard statements.

2. **Time Complexity Summary**

   - **Naive**: \(O(N^2 \times L)\) for building or scanning adjacency.
   - **Wildcard**: ~\(O(N \times L^2)\) typical.
   - **Bidirectional BFS** can reduce the effective search depth in half.

3. **Why Wildcard Patterns Help**

   - Instead of comparing each word against all others, we transform each word into its \(L\) "wildcard keys" (like `h*t`) and store them in a hash map.
   - This offers direct neighbor lookups in BFS, usually saving a ton of comparisons.

4. **Python String Slicing Cost**
   - Doing `word[:i] + '*' + word[i+1:]` is \(O(L)\), so keep that in mind. Sometimes you'll see it referred to as \(O(N \times L)\), but strictly speaking, it's \(O(N \times L^2)\) considering the slicing cost.

---

# Conclusion

**Word Ladder** is an excellent demonstration of how **string manipulation** can be reframed as a **graph shortest-path** problem:

- **Approach 1 & 2**: Build or dynamically compare words in \(O(N^2 \times L)\).
- **Approach 3**: Use **wildcard patterns** for an often much faster BFS (\(O(N \times L^2)\)).
- **Approach 4**: **Bidirectional BFS** can cut search depths drastically, making it the most optimal variant when implemented with wildcard mappings.

When implementing in a real interview:

1. Start with a BFS approach.
2. If the interviewer asks about efficiency or the dictionary is large, move to **wildcard** or **bidirectional BFS**.
3. Always note edge cases, slicing costs, and potential extreme scenarios.

With these methods, you'll be well-equipped to handle Word Ladder questions confidentlyâand possibly adapt similar ideas for other **one-letter transformation** puzzles.
