### Building a Modern Web Stack with Nginx, Supabase, and Vercel Edge Functions

Today, I explored the combination of **Nginx**, **Supabase**, and **Vercel Edge Functions** to build a scalable, performant, and developer-friendly web architecture. Here's a record of key questions and technical findings I worked through.

---

### 💡 Can Nginx Do Rate Limiting?

Yes. Nginx has built-in rate limiting using two main directives:

- `limit_req_zone`: defines the memory zone and request rate.
- `limit_req`: applies the rate limit in specific locations.

Example:

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=req_zone:10m rate=1r/s;

location /api/ {
    limit_req zone=req_zone burst=5 nodelay;
}
```

This allows IP-based request throttling to protect backend services.

---

### 🌐 Can Nginx Work with Cloudflare Tunnel Locally?

Yes, and it's a powerful combo. Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) allows you to expose your local Nginx server (or any service) to the public internet **without a public IP** or port forwarding.

Basic steps:

1. Install `cloudflared` and run `cloudflared tunnel login`.
2. Create a tunnel: `cloudflared tunnel create my-tunnel`.
3. Configure `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`:

```yaml
tunnel: my-tunnel-id
credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/my-tunnel-id.json

ingress:
  - hostname: nginx.example.com
    service: http://localhost:80
  - service: http_status:404
```

4. Run the tunnel: `cloudflared tunnel run my-tunnel`.

Cloudflare will handle HTTPS, DNS, and global access.

---

### 🔁 Can Nginx Solve CORS?

Yes, by using **reverse proxy**, you can bypass CORS entirely from the browser’s perspective.

Frontend requests `/api/...`, Nginx proxies that to your real backend:

```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}
```

Since the request appears same-origin to the browser, CORS is avoided. No need to add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers.

---

### 🧩 Other Ways to Handle CORS?

Besides Nginx reverse proxy, common methods include:

- **Backend CORS headers** (e.g., in FastAPI, Express, Flask)
- **Frontend dev proxy** (`vite.config.ts`, `CRA`'s `proxy`)
- **Cloudflare Workers / Vercel Edge Functions** as remote proxies

Each has tradeoffs, but proxying in the same origin (via Nginx or Next.js API Routes) is usually the cleanest.

---

### 🧪 How Does This Work with Vercel + Next.js + Supabase?

Next.js supports native API Routes under `/pages/api/*`, which are deployed as serverless functions (typically AWS Lambda).

Pattern:

- Frontend fetches `/api/data`
- `/pages/api/data.ts` handles the request
- Inside the handler, it queries Supabase:

```ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.from('todos').select('*')
  res.status(200).json(data)
}
```

No CORS issue, because the request is same-origin.

### ⚡ What Are Edge Functions and Why No Cold Start?

Edge Functions are small pieces of code that run on Vercel’s Edge Network (similar to Cloudflare Workers). They don’t use Node.js — instead, they run in a lightweight **V8 sandbox**, which enables near-instant execution and **no cold start**.

They’re great for:

- Cookie parsing
- Auth header injection
- Lightweight logic close to the user

They are **not good for**:

- Heavy database queries
- Anything that uses Node.js native modules

---

### ❌ Why Not Use Edge Functions for Database Access?

- They **don’t support Node.js**, so libraries like `pg`, `mysql2`, `mongoose` won’t work.
- If you try to use Supabase with `service_role` key in Edge code, you risk leaking it (e.g., if bundled improperly or exposed to the client).
- Also, Edge regions may be far from your DB region, causing latency.

Instead, use Serverless Functions (API Routes) for database access.

---

### ✅ Can You Use Supabase in Edge Functions at All?

Yes, with some limitations:

- You **can** use `anon` keys to query public data
- You **should not** use `service_role` keys (security risk)
- Use the `@supabase/supabase-js` client with `persistSession: false` in Edge runtime

Example:

```ts
export const runtime = 'edge'

export async function GET() {
  const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, {
    auth: { persistSession: false },
  })

  const { data } = await supabase.from('todos').select('*')
  return NextResponse.json(data)
}
```

## 📊 Architecture Diagrams

To clarify the two different deployment setups discussed today, here are two separate diagrams representing:

- A local development environment using **Nginx + Cloudflare Tunnel**
- A cloud-based deployment using **Vercel + Supabase + Edge/Serverless Functions**

---

### 🖥️ Local Development with Nginx + Cloudflare Tunnel

This architecture is suitable for local development where you serve static files or APIs locally and expose them securely using Cloudflare Tunnel without needing a public IP.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Browser] --> B[Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared)]
    B --> C[Nginx (localhost)]
    C -->|/api/*| D[Backend API Service (localhost:8000)]
    C -->|Other| E[Static Files (index.html, js, css)]
```

📝 **Explanation**:

- The browser accesses a public domain (e.g. `nginx.example.com`) routed through Cloudflare Tunnel.
- Tunnel connects to your local Nginx server.
- Nginx serves static files and proxies `/api` to your backend.

---

### ☁️ Cloud Deployment with Vercel + Supabase + Edge Functions

This setup represents a modern cloud-based architecture with global distribution and built-in scaling.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Browser] --> B[Vercel Hosting (Next.js)]
    B --> C{Request Type}
    C -->|/api/*| D[Vercel Serverless Function]
    C -->|/app/api/*| E[Vercel Edge Function]

    D --> F[Supabase (Database + Auth)]
    E -->|Read-only<br/>anon key only| F
```

📝 **Explanation**:

- Browser sends requests to your Vercel-hosted site.
- Depending on the path, the request is routed to:
  - A **Serverless Function** (`/pages/api`) for full Node.js support and database access.
  - An **Edge Function** (`/app/api`) for ultra-fast logic at the edge, without service key access.
- Both interact with **Supabase**, but only Serverless Functions should use secure service keys.
