## Introduction

A monotonic stack is an efficient data structure for solving problems that involve finding the first element to the left or right that satisfies a certain condition. It often provides solutions with O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large-scale array operations.

In this article, we will discuss how to use a monotonic stack to compute:

- **RightClosestGreater**: For each element, the next greater element to the right.  
- **LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual**: For each element, the closest element to the left that is greater or equal.  

We will maintain the stack in a **non-strictly decreasing** order based on the condition that:

> **If the new element is greater than the element at the top of the stack, the new element is the RightClosestGreater for the popped element.**

After handling the popping phase, if the stack is not empty, the top of the stack is the **LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual** for the current element.

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Initialization**  
   We initialize:  
   - A `RightClosestGreater` array of length `n` (where `n` is the size of the input array), filled with `n` to indicate that no greater element is found to the right by default.  
   - A `LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual` array of length `n`, filled with `-1` to indicate that no greater or equal element is found to the left by default.  
   - A stack `st` to maintain indices of elements. For this problem, we maintain the stack in **non-strictly decreasing** order, which means:  
     - For any two indices `i` and `j` in the stack with `i` below `j`, we have `nums[i] >= nums[j]`.

2. **Traversal**  
   We iterate through the array from left to right. For each element `nums[i]`:  
   - While the stack is not empty and `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[st.top()]`, we pop the top element from the stack.  
     - For the popped element `nums[idx]`, the current element `nums[i]` is its **RightClosestGreater**.  
   - After the popping phase, if the stack is not empty, `st.top()` is the **LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual** for the current element.  
   - Finally, we push the current index `i` onto the stack to maintain the stack property.

3. **Monotonic Stack Behavior**  
   Since the stack is non-strictly decreasing, each new element is compared against the top of the stack until a greater or equal element is found. This ensures that every element is pushed and popped at most once, achieving O(n) complexity.

## Code Implementation (Python)

```python
def find_right_and_left_closest_greater(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    # Initialize RightClosestGreater: default n means no greater element found
    RightClosestGreater = [n] * n
    # Initialize LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual: default -1 means no such element
    LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual = [-1] * n

    # 'st' is a monotonic stack storing indices.
    # It is maintained in a non-strictly decreasing order:
    # For indices i and j, if i is below j, then nums[i] >= nums[j].
    st = []

    # Traverse the array from left to right
    for i in range(n):
        # While stack is not empty and the current element nums[i] is greater than
        # the element at the index stored at the top of the stack...
        while st and nums[i] > nums[st[-1]]:
            # The new element nums[i] is the RightClosestGreater for the popped element
            idx = st.pop()
            RightClosestGreater[idx] = i

        # If the stack is not empty after the while loop,
        # the top element is the LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual for the current element
        if st:
            LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual[i] = st[-1]

        # Push the current index to the stack
        st.append(i)

    return RightClosestGreater, LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual


# Example usage
nums = [3, 1, 4, 2]
RightClosestGreater, LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual = find_right_and_left_closest_greater(nums)

# Print the results
print("Index:                    ", [i for i in range(len(nums))])
print("Nums:                     ", nums)
print("RightClosestGreater:      ", RightClosestGreater)
print("LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual:", LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual)
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

For the input array:

```
nums = [3, 1, 4, 2]
```

**Step 1: i = 0 (nums[0] = 3)**  
- Stack empty → push index `0`.  
- `st = [0]`  
- LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual[0] = -1 (no element to the left).  

**Step 2: i = 1 (nums[1] = 1)**  
- `nums[1] = 1 < nums[st[-1]] = 3` → push index `1`.  
- `st = [0, 1]`  
- LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual[1] = 0 (index 0 has `3`, which is greater than or equal to `1`).  

**Step 3: i = 2 (nums[2] = 4)**  
- `nums[2] = 4 > nums[st[-1]] = 1` → pop index `1`:  
  - RightClosestGreater[1] = 2 (4 is the next greater element for `1`).  
- `nums[2] = 4 > nums[st[-1]] = 3` → pop index `0`:  
  - RightClosestGreater[0] = 2 (4 is the next greater element for `3`).  
- Stack empty → push index `2`.  
- `st = [2]`  
- LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual[2] = -1 (no greater-or-equal element to the left).  

**Step 4: i = 3 (nums[3] = 2)**  
- `nums[3] = 2 < nums[st[-1]] = 4` → push index `3`.  
- `st = [2, 3]`  
- LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual[3] = 2 (index 2 has `4`, which is greater than or equal to `2`).  

**Final Stack State:**  
- `st = [2, 3]`

**Final Arrays:**  
- **RightClosestGreater:** `[2, 2, 4, 4]`  
- **LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual:** `[-1, 0, -1, 2]`

## Explanation of the Final Arrays

1. **RightClosestGreater:**  
   For each element, it stores the index of the next greater element to the right.  
   - Index 0 (`3`): Next greater element is at index 2 (`4`).  
   - Index 1 (`1`): Next greater element is at index 2 (`4`).  
   - Index 2 (`4`): No greater element to the right → value is `4` (the array length).  
   - Index 3 (`2`): No greater element to the right → value is `4`.

2. **LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual:**  
   For each element, it stores the index of the closest greater or equal element to the left.  
   - Index 0 (`3`): No left element → `-1`.  
   - Index 1 (`1`): Left closest greater or equal is index 0 (`3`).  
   - Index 2 (`4`): No greater or equal element on the left → `-1`.  
   - Index 3 (`2`): Left closest greater or equal is index 2 (`4`).

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — Each element is pushed onto and popped from the stack at most once.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) — We store two arrays of size `n` and maintain a stack.

## Variations and Applications

1. **Nearest Smaller Elements:**  
   By reversing the comparison condition, we can find the next smaller elements to the right or the closest smaller elements to the left.

2. **Histogram Largest Rectangle:**  
   A monotonic stack can find the largest rectangle in a histogram in O(n) time.

3. **Stock Span Problem:**  
   The monotonic stack helps compute the number of consecutive days with a price less than or equal to the current day's price.

4. **Sliding Window Maximum:**  
   A monotonic deque (double-ended queue) can find the maximum value in a sliding window.

## Conclusion

The monotonic stack, when maintained in **non-strictly decreasing** or **non-strictly increasing** order based on the comparison condition, can efficiently solve various "nearest greater or smaller" problems.  

In this implementation, we calculated:  
- **RightClosestGreater** — the next greater element to the right (initialized with `n`).  
- **LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual** — the closest greater or equal element to the left (initialized with `-1`).  

The core insight:  
> **If the new element is greater than the element at the top of the stack, it becomes the RightClosestGreater for the popped element.**  
After popping, the top of the stack (if it exists) is the **LeftClosestGreaterOrEqual** for the new element.  

With one pass and O(n) complexity, monotonic stacks provide a clean and optimal solution to these classical array problems.
